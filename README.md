 Configure DHCPv4
Objectives
Part 1: Configure a Router as a DHCP Server

Part 2: Configure DHCP Relay

Part 3: Configure a Router as a DHCP Client

Part 4: Verify DHCP and Connectivity

Scenario
A dedicated DHCP server is scalable and relatively easy to manage but it can be costly to have one at every location in a network. However, a Cisco router can be configured to provide DHCP services without the need for a dedicated server. As the network technician for your company, you have been assigned the task of configuring a Cisco router as a DHCP server. You are also required to configure the edge router as a DHCP client so that it receives an IP address from the ISP network.
